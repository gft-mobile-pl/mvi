# MVI ViewModel

[[_TOC_]]

## TL;DR
1. Define contract:
```kotlin
@Parcelize
data class ChoiceViewState(
    val randomNumber: Int
) : ViewState, Parcelable

sealed interface ChoiceViewEvent : ViewEvent {
    data class OnShowDetailsClicked(val id: String) : ChoiceViewEvent
    object OnDrawNumberClicked : ChoiceViewEvent
    object OnShowToastClicked : ChoiceViewEvent
}

sealed interface ChoiceNavigationEffect : NavigationEffect {
    data class NavigateToDetails(val id: String) : ChoiceNavigationEffect
}

sealed interface ChoiceViewEffect : ViewEffect {
    data class ShowToast(val message: String) : ChoiceViewEffect
}
```
2. Implement view-model:
```kotlin
class ChoiceViewModel(
    savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle,
) : BaseMviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect>(
    ChoiceViewState(0), savedStateHandle
) {
    override fun onEvent(event: ChoiceViewEvent) {

        when (event) {
            is OnShowDetailsClicked -> {
                dispatchNavigationEffect(NavigateToDetails(event.id))
            }
            OnDrawNumberClicked -> {
                viewState = viewState.copy(
                    randomNumber = Random.nextInt(0, 100)
                )
            }
            OnShowToastClicked -> {
                dispatchViewEffect(ChoiceViewEffect.ShowToast("Toast message!"))
            }
        }
    }
}
```
3. Bind view to view-model
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChoiceScreen(
    viewModel: MviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect> = koinViewModel<ChoiceViewModel>(),
    onNavigateToDetails: (String) -> Unit
) {

    NavigationEffect(viewModel) { effect ->
        when (effect) {
            is NavigateToDetails -> {
                onNavigateToDetails(effect.id)
            }
        }
    }

    ViewEffect(viewModel) { effect ->
        when (effect) {
            is ShowToast -> Toast.makeText(context, effect.message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
    }

    // Option A
    ViewState(viewModel) {
        Text(
            text = "${viewState.randomNumber}",
            style = TextStyle.Default.copy(
                fontSize = 72.sp
            )
        )
    }
    
    // Option B (less indents!)
    val viewState by viewState(viewModel)
    Text(
        text = "${viewState.randomNumber}",
        style = TextStyle.Default.copy(
            fontSize = 72.sp
        )
    )
}
```
4. Provide `@Preview`
```kotlin
@Preview(showSystemUi = true, heightDp = 800)
@Composable
fun ChoiceScreenPreview() {
    ChoiceScreen(
        viewModel = ChoiceViewState(randomNumber = 16).toViewModel(), // uses TestMviViewModel under the hood
        onNavigateToDetails = {}
    )
}
```

## Usage

### Define contract between view and view-model
- Your view state class has to implemented `ViewState` marker interface.
- View events have to implemented `ViewEvent` marker interface.
- Navigation effects have to implemented `NavigationEffect` marker interface.
- View effects have to implemented `ViewEffect` marker interface.
```kotlin
@Parcelize
data class ChoiceViewState(
    val randomNumber: Int
) : ViewState, Parcelable

sealed interface ChoiceViewEvent : ViewEvent {
    data class OnShowDetailsClicked(val id: String) : ChoiceViewEvent
    object OnDrawNumberClicked : ChoiceViewEvent
    object OnShowToastClicked : ChoiceViewEvent
}

sealed interface ChoiceNavigationEffect : NavigationEffect {
    data class NavigateToDetails(val id: String) : ChoiceNavigationEffect
}

sealed interface ChoiceViewEffect : ViewEffect {
    data class ShowToast(val message: String) : ChoiceViewEffect
}
```
> ℹ Your view state doesn't have to implement `Parcelable` interface if you don't intend to store the view state in `SavedStateHandle`.

> ℹ You don't have to define empty classes, e.g. if you don't need `view effect` simply don't define it. 

> ℹ `ViewState`, `ViewEvent`, `NavigationEffect`, `ViewEffect` are just marker interfaces. 
> Theoretically we would be just fine without them but:
> - They open possibility to create extensions methods which are scoped to the particular parts of MVI contract:
>   - Absolutely life-saver when dealing with `@Preview`
>     ```kotlin
>     @Preview(showSystemUi = true, heightDp = 800)
>     @Composable
>     fun ChoiceScreenPreview() {
>       ChoiceScreen(
>         viewModel = ChoiceViewState(randomNumber = 16).toViewModel(), // uses TestMviViewModel under the hood
>         onNavigateToDetails = {}
>       )
>     }
>     ```
>   - Very useful when creating instrumented tests when view-model is required by Fragment/Composable.
> - They prevent various common mistakes like when the generic parameters are specified in a wrong order while defining view-model.


### Define view-model

#### Using `BaseMviViewModel`

The only requirement is to implement `MviViewModel` interface, but 99% of the time it would be easier to inherit from `BaseMviViewModel`:

```kotlin
class ChoiceViewModel(
    savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle,
) : BaseMviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect>(
    ChoiceViewState(0), savedStateHandle
) {
    override fun onEvent(event: ChoiceViewEvent) {

    }
}
```

`BaseMviViewModel` accepts two parameters:
- `initialViewState` - in the MVI (and Compose) the initial state of the view is always required.<br />
ℹ initial data may not be a "correct" if you plan to provide the real data synchronously 
in the `init` block (e.g. using `launch(start = CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED) {}`) 
- `savedStateHandle` (optional) - if you pass `SavedStateHandle` to the `BaseMviViewModel` it will automatically save/restore the view state when activity is killed/recreated.

It is also possible to inherit from `BaseMviViewModel` and override particular fields:
```kotlin
class ChoiceViewModel(streamData: StreamUserChoiceDataUseCase) : BaseMviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect>(ChoiceViewState(0)) {

    override val viewStates = streamData()
        .map { data -> ChoiceViewState(data) }
        .stateIn(viewModelScope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(), ChoiceViewState(0))

    override fun onEvent(event: ChoiceViewEvent) {}
}
```
This approach saves a bit of time as the rest of the fields are provided by the `BaseMviViewModel` however:
- you still need to pass `initialState` to the constructor even though it won't be used,
- if you override `viewStates` field the automatic save/restore mechanism won't work anymore even if you pass `SavedStateHandle` to the base class constructor.


#### Using `MviViewModel` interface

Extending `BaseMviViewModel` is not mandatory - it is enough to implement the `MviViewModel`. This is very useful if you don't want to manage the ViewState "manually" inside the view-model, 
but rather fetch it from domain.

```kotlin
class ChoiceViewModel(streamData: StreamUserChoiceDataUseCase) : MviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect>, ViewModel() {
    
    override val viewStates: StateFlow<ChoiceViewState> = streamData()
        .map { data -> ChoiceViewState(data) }
        .stateIn(viewModelScope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(), ChoiceViewState(0))
    
    override val viewEffects: StateFlow<ConsumableEvent<ChoiceViewEffect>?> = MutableStateFlow<ConsumableEvent<ChoiceViewEffect>?>(null)
    override val navigationEffects: StateFlow<ConsumableEvent<ChoiceNavigationEffect>?> = MutableStateFlow<ConsumableEvent<ChoiceNavigationEffect>?>(null)
    override fun onEvent(event: ChoiceViewEvent) { }
}
```

Special caution is required while defining and assigning fields at the same time, e.g.
```kotlin
override val viewEffects: StateFlow<ConsumableEvent<ChoiceViewEffect>?> = MutableStateFlow<ConsumableEvent<ChoiceViewEffect>?>(null)
```
> ⚠ You should explicitly type all MVI fields to `StateFlow<...>` - otherwise you will expose the assigned object (usually `MutableStateFlow`). As a rule of thumb you should use backing fields to avoid this inconvenience:
```kotlin
private val _viewEffects = MutableStateFlow<ConsumableEvent<ChoiceViewEffect>?>(null)
override val viewEffects: StateFlow<ConsumableEvent<ChoiceViewEffect>?> = _viewEffect
```
Don't worry - you will be still able to mutate the view state even if you choose the first option (defining and assigning at the same time) - read on..

#### Updating view state
If you extend `BaseMviViewModel` OR your custom view-model assigns `MutableStateFlow` to `val viewStates: StateFlow<VS>` you may use `viewState` extension method to update the view state:

```kotlin
class ChoiceViewModel ... {
    ... 
    private fun drawNumber() {
        viewState = viewState.copy(
            randomNumber = Random.nextInt(0, 100)
        )    
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Dispatching view effects
If you extend `BaseMviViewModel` OR your custom view-model assigns `MutableStateFlow` to `val viewEffects: StateFlow<ConsumableEvent<VE>?>` you may use `dispatchViewEffect` extension method:

```kotlin
class ChoiceViewModel ... {
    ... 
    private fun showToast() {
        dispatchViewEffect(ChoiceViewEffect.ShowToast("Toast message!")) 
    }
    ...
}
```
> ⚠ Most of the time you should not use view effects at all - even displaying the `AlertDialogs` should generally be managed with the view state.

#### Dispatching navigation effects
If you extend `BaseMviViewModel` OR your custom view-model assigns `MutableStateFlow` to `val navigationEffects: StateFlow<ConsumableEvent<NE>?>` you may use `dispatchNavigationEffect` extension method:

```kotlin
class ChoiceViewModel ... {
    ... 
    private fun navigateToCardDetails() {
        dispatchNavigationEffect(NavigateToDetails(event.id))
    }
    ...
}
```

### Use view-model (Compose)

#### Injecting view-model

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChoiceScreen(
    viewModel: MviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect> = viewModel<ChoiceViewModel>(),
)
```
> ⚠ Generally you should type the `viewModel` parameter to the `MviViewModel<...>` interface. 
> Otherwise providing preview may be very hard especially if your view-model has many dependencies (e.g. tons of use cases).
>
> If you really don't intend to use preview you may simplify the view-model injection (still not recommended as makes testing harder):
> ```kotlin
> @Composable
> fun ChoiceScreen(
>     viewModel: ChoiceViewModel = viewModel(),
> )
> ```

You may provide parameters to view-models during injection:
```kotlin
class DetailsViewModelFactory(private val id: String) : ViewModelProvider.NewInstanceFactory() {
    override fun <T : ViewModel> create(modelClass: Class<T>): T = DetailsViewModel(id) as T
}

@Composable
fun DetailsScreen(
    id: String,
    viewModel: MviViewModel<DetailsViewState, ViewEvent, NavigationEffect, ViewEffect> = viewModel(factory = DetailsViewModelFactory(id)),
) {

}
```

#### Injecting view-model with Koin

First you need to declare view-models in Koin `module`.
```kotlin
val appUiModule = module {
    viewModelOf(::ChoiceViewModel)
    viewModel { parameters -> DetailsViewModel(parameters.get()) } // view-model with parameter
}
```

The injection is straightforward.
```kotlin
// view-model without parameters (beside SavedStateHandle)
@Composable
fun ChoiceScreen(
    viewModel: MviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect> = koinViewModel<ChoiceViewModel>(),
    onNavigateToDetails: (String) -> Unit
)

// view-model with parameter
@Composable
fun DetailsScreen(
    id: String,
    viewModel: MviViewModel<DetailsViewState, ViewEvent, NavigationEffect, ViewEffect> = koinViewModel<DetailsViewModel> { parametersOf(id) }
)
```

#### Handling view state changes.
There are two equivalent methods of handling view state changes.

First option is to use `ViewState` composable. Inside the passed content lambda there is a `viewState` property available which holds the latest view state.
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChoiceScreen(
    viewModel: MviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect> = koinViewModel<ChoiceViewModel>(),
    onNavigateToDetails: (String) -> Unit
) {
    ViewState(viewModel) {
        Text(
            text = "${viewState.randomNumber}",
            style = TextStyle.Default.copy(
                fontSize = 72.sp
            )
        )
    }
    ...
}
```
>ℹ Although the `viewState` field is typed to `<VS : ViewState>` it is a delegate pointing to a `<State<VS : ViewState>>` under the hood.
Thanks to this the whole view is not recomposed when the `viewState` changes - only the parts reading from `viewState` are recomposed.

The second option is to use `by viewState(viewModel)` delegation:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChoiceScreen(
    viewModel: MviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect> = koinViewModel<ChoiceViewModel>(),
    onNavigateToDetails: (String) -> Unit
) {
    val viewState by viewState(viewModel)
    
    Text(
        text = "${viewState.randomNumber}",
        style = TextStyle.Default.copy(
            fontSize = 72.sp
        )
    )
}
```
>ℹ Although the `viewState` variable is typed to `<VS : ViewState>` it is a delegate pointing to a `<State<VS : ViewState>>` under the hood.
Thanks to this the whole view is not recomposed when the `viewState` changes - only the parts reading from `viewState` are recomposed.

#### View state subscription lifetime

By default both the `ViewState` and `by viewState(viewModel)` subscribes to the `viewModel.viewStates` flow when view enters `Lifecycle.State.STARTED`
state and cancels the subscription when view is stopped.

In some rare scenarios you may want to keep the subscription alive even if the view is not visible (not in `Lifecycle.State.STARTED` state),
especially if the `viewModel.viewStates` is backed by a cold flow that should keep working even if app is in background.
You may specify the minimum lifecycle state at which the subscription is active using `minActiveState` param:

```kotlin
ViewState(
    viewModel = viewModel,
    minActiveState = Lifecycle.State.CREATED
) { effect ->

}
```
```kotlin
val viewState by viewState(viewModel = viewModel, minActiveState = Lifecycle.State.CREATED)
```
> ℹ Although using `Lifecycle.State.CREATED` as `minActiveState` keeps the subscription active the Compose suspends recomposition when view is stopped.
> Thanks to this the app is not wasting resources on invisible updates while the view model may keep its work.

#### Handling navigation effects

Use `NavigationEffect` composable method to handle navigation effects. 
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChoiceScreen(
    viewModel: MviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect> = koinViewModel<ChoiceViewModel>(),
    onNavigateToDetails: (String) -> Unit
) {
    NavigationEffect(viewModel) { effect ->
        when (effect) {
            is NavigateToDetails -> {
                onNavigateToDetails(effect.id)
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
> ℹ Each navigation effect is provided only once. It won't be repeated even if the view is recreated.

By default the `NavigationEffect` handles the navigation effects only if the view is at least in the `Lifecycle.State.STARTED` state.
If the application is in background or user has navigated to any other screen the navigation effects are ignored.
When user returns only the last navigation effect fired in the meantime by the view-model is handled.

You may change this behavior by defining the required minimum view state, e.g. if you pass the `Lifecycle.State.RESUMED`
all the view navigation will be ignored if the view is visible but paused.
```kotlin
NavigationEffect(
    viewModel = viewModel,
    minActiveState = Lifecycle.State.RESUMED
) { effect ->

}
```
> ⚠ In Compose it is impossible to handle navigation effects when the view is not started even if you pass `Lifecycle.State.CREATED` as minimum view state.
All the recompositions are suspended when the view is in stopped.

#### Handling view effects

Use `ViewEffect` composable method to handle view effects.
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChoiceScreen(
    viewModel: MviViewModel<ChoiceViewState, ChoiceViewEvent, ChoiceNavigationEffect, ChoiceViewEffect> = koinViewModel<ChoiceViewModel>(),
    onNavigateToDetails: (String) -> Unit
) {
    ViewEffect(viewModel) { effect ->
        when (effect) {
            is ShowToast -> Toast.makeText(context, effect.message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
> ℹ Each view effect is provided only once. It won't be repeated even if the view is recreated.

By default the `ViewEffect` handles the view effects only if the view is at least in the `Lifecycle.State.STARTED` state.

}
```

### Use view-model (View) - TBD
